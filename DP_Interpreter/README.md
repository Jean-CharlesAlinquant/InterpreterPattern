# Interpreter Pattern Definition

The Interpreter Pattern is used to define the grammar of a language and interpret sentences in that language. It provides a way to evaluate sentences or expressions represented in a language, typically in the form of a domain-specific language (DSL), by defining a grammar and creating an interpreter that can evaluate expressions in that grammar.
